# Christmas-Day-Problem
The "Christmas Day Problem" is not about how to assemble a 300 piece playhouse an hour before the kids get up. It refers to a common issue with events from a SharePoint Event List that are tagged as an All Day Event, and how those events are queried and displayed in Handshake controls.
